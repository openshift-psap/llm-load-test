In 1989, Anthony \"Swoff\" Swofford, whose father served in the Vietnam War, attends U.S. Marine Corps training before being stationed at Camp Pendleton. Claiming that he joined the military because he \"got lost on the way to college\", Swofford finds his time at Camp Pendleton difficult, and struggles to make friends. While Swofford feigns illness to avoid his responsibilities, a \"lifer\", Staff Sergeant Sykes, takes note of his potential and orders Swofford to attend his Scout Sniper course. After grueling training, the Scout Sniper course is left with eight candidates, among them Swofford, now a sniper, and Swofford's roommate Corporal Alan Troy who becomes his spotter. When Iraq invades Kuwait, Swofford's unit is deployed to the Arabian Peninsula as a part of Operation Desert Shield. Eager for combat, the Marines find themselves bored with remedial training, constant drills, and a routine monotony that feeds their boredom, and prompts them to talk about the unfaithful girlfriends and wives waiting for them at home. They even erect a bulletin board featuring photographs and brief notes telling what perfidies the women had committed. Swofford obtains unauthorized alcohol and organizes an impromptu Christmas party, arranging for Fergus to cover his watch so he can celebrate. Fergus accidentally sets fire to a tent while cooking some sausages and ignites a crate of flares, waking the whole camp and enraging Staff Sergeant Sykes, who demotes Swofford from lance corporal to private and puts him on \"shit-burning\" detail. The punishments, combined with the heat, the boredom, and Swofford's suspicions of his girlfriend's infidelity, give Swofford a mental breakdown, to the point where he threatens Fergus with a rifle, then orders Fergus to shoot him instead.\nAnswer:",

If not, let me know by writing \"Not answerable\".  Plot title: Mega Shark Vs. Giant Octopus Movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus. MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to man-made global warming, and wonders if the creatures are mankind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomeuppance\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

In this respect the book presents the language very succinctly and logically and endows you with a firm foundation in understanding its structure which allows you to go away and generalise very easily; very useful for further learning. This, I think, more than makes up for a more ad hoc approach. After all, MSA is descended from the Quran whose language is extremely mathematically elegant. It only seems right that we try to understand the language at this depth if we are to truly appreciate it. Answer:\nA:",

Which village has more dangerous cycling conditions?  Two villages are inhabited by lots of people that ride bicycles. Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, and Low village is situated in a valley, and has more sunny days.  Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]\nAnswer:",

The. presence of Instagram also hints that the device will have a camera. As the watch. doesn\u2019t link with a phone, but stores music, it suggests the watch will. have a substantial amount of storage - which will need to be a minimum. of 4GB to be useful. If the watch has Bluetooth connectivity, it\u2019s likely to also have Wi-Fi capabilities and may even add NFC. Due to the fact it can make calls, the watch is also likely to have a SIM card and may additionally support 3G, or even 4G. If it does come with a data plan, the storage may be reduced if music can be streamed from the cloud. During the show, will.i.am told Alan Carr: 'I don\u2019t carry my phone anymore, this is my phone. \u2018A lot of these smartwatches need phones - mine doesn\u2019t need a phone.

It was also slammed for being too restrictive because it only worked with select Samsung devices. Some analysts claimed the watch was rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market, beating Apple and Google to their still rumoured devices. In November, Samsung declared it was the bestselling smartwatch ever, quoting sales figures of 800,000 - yet industry sources claimed this number was closer to 50,000 and the higher figure was actually the number of watches that had been shipped. Windows Phone, for example, has fewer apps and Apple's iOS is a proprietary software used only on its own devices. That is, of course, unless Will.i.am\u2019s also developed a bespoke OS and custom-made versions of these apps. The presence of Instagram hints that the device will have a camera. Will.i.am recently announced plans to release a camera accessory that will \u2018dramatically enhance the clarity and definition of iPhone photographs\u2019 called the i.am+. It is said to be capable of raising the quality of photos from 8MP to 14MP and will.i.am\u2019s watch may either run with an 8MP camera, or work with this accessory.

His first two wives left him, but the story didn't end there, and things got tricky with his third and fourth wives. His third wife, Kathleen Savio, was found dead in 2004. At first, people thought it was an accident, but later, some people started to think that maybe Drew had something to do with her death.\n\nThen, in 2007, Drew's fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared, and no one knew where she was. Because of this, people started looking more closely at what happened to Kathleen, Drew's third wife. They thought that maybe Drew had hurt her too.\n\nSo, the police decided to put Drew in handcuffs and chains and take him to a place called jail. When people asked Drew about the handcuffs and chains, he said, \"I got the bling. Can't complain.\" That means he was trying to say he didn't care about the handcuffs and chains because they were like fancy jewelry.\n\nDrew said, through his special helper called an attorney, that he didn't do anything wrong to either his third or fourth wife. An attorney is someone who helps people with problems related to the law.\n\nIn the end, the police will have to work hard to find out the truth about what happened to both of these missing wives. They will have to listen to stories, look for clues, and use their detective skills to put the puzzle pieces together.",

However, it is important to note that Hales' absence does not necessarily mean that England will be unable to perform well in the 50-over game. \n\nTo complete the passage, I will continue by discussing the potential impact of Hales' absence on England's batting lineup. \n\nFirstly, Hales' unbeaten 116 in the World Twenty20 tournament showcased his ability to score big runs and play match-winning innings. His aggressive batting style and ability to hit boundaries at will made him a valuable asset for England. Without Hales, England might lack a player who can consistently provide explosive starts at the top of the order.\n\nHowever, it is worth considering that Hales' technique has been criticized for being too loose for the 50-over game. This suggests that his absence might actually provide an opportunity for another player with a more solid technique to step up and contribute to the team's success. \n\nAdditionally, England has a talented pool of batsmen to choose from, including players like Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, and Jos Buttler, who have proven themselves in the limited-overs format. These players have the ability to anchor the innings and build partnerships, which can be crucial in setting up a competitive total.\n\nFurthermore, Hales' absence might also allow England to experiment with their batting order and try out different combinations. This could potentially lead to the discovery of new talents and provide the team with more flexibility in their approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while Hales' absence may be seen as a disadvantage for England in the 50-over game, it also presents an opportunity for other players to step up and contribute to the team's success. With a talented batting lineup and the potential for experimentation, England has the ability to overcome this challenge and perform well in the absence of Hales.",

It was an unbeaten 116 from Hales that enabled England to become the only team to defeat Sri Lanka in that world tournament in Bangladesh in March. He appeared poised to do the same in the first big match of the Peter Moores era. Hales smashed 66 off 41 balls to lift England within reach of their formidable target of 184. But  Malinga, still the best \u2018death bowler\u2019 in the world, deceived him with a perfect slower ball to  earn Sri Lanka the spoils.\n\nThe fact they will attempt to do so without Hales, whose technique is still considered too loose for the 50-over game, might be something",
